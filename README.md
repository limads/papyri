# About

`papyri` is a vector plotting library based on `cairo`. Its primary purpose is to offer seamless plotting capabilities to GTK applications. The library export a C API, that can be leveraged by GTK applications written in C, or embedded at other programming environments. The generated plots export to svg, png and eps, therefore it is also suited as a stand-alone visualization library targeted at printed documents or web-pages.
