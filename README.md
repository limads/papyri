# About

`papyri` is a vector graphing library based on `cairo`. Its primary purpose is to offer seamless plotting capabilities
to Rust-based GTK applications. Eventually the library will export a C API, that can be leveraged by GTK applications
written in C, or embedded at other programming environments. The generated plots can be exported to svg, png and eps,
therefore it is also suited as a stand-alone visualization library targeted at printed documents or web-pages.

The application exports a command-line tool, `papyri`, that is cargo-installable and can be used to validate and evaluate plots
from a JSON definition.

# Showcase
